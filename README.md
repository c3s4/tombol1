# Tombolone

Tombolone is the desktop version of the man who extract numbers for the [Tombola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tombola_%28raffle%29), a typical italian game we use to play during the Christmas days.

Tombolone will extract numbers and will show in the billboard.

It's mainly an experiment to play with [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org).
